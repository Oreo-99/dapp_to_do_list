# TodoList Project

This project is a simple TodoList application built on the Aptos blockchain platform using React for the frontend. Users can create tasks, mark them as completed, and view their tasks in a list format.

## Features

- **Create Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to their TodoList by entering task content into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox next to each task in the list.
- **Random Task Display**: Incomplete tasks are displayed randomly, giving users a fresh perspective on their tasks each time they visit the TodoList.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Ant Design**: Ant Design components are used for UI elements, providing a clean and modern design.
- **Aptos Blockchain**: The backend logic is implemented on the Aptos blockchain platform, allowing for decentralized storage and execution of tasks.
- **Lodash**: The Lodash library is used for shuffling tasks to display them randomly.
